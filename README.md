# NBA Team Success and Player Contract Analyses

This project is from my Analytics Practicum during grad school. It is a handful of analyses used to explore some NBA team success and player contract valuation using Python and SAS Viya.

The .ipynb was from the early phases of this project doing some data exploration and early metric creation. The majority of this project is contained in the PowerPoint presentation and it elaborates on the SAS Viya tools used for the analyses. All the data was grabbed from basketball-reference.com and are attached in this repo.
